					<h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
					<p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
					<p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
					<h5>About Adam</h5>
					<p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services.

					<h5>The Business of Play</h5>
					<p>Play isn&#8217;t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that &#8211; and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn&#8217;t about those surface elements either &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating an environment with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you&#8217;re trying to encourage people &#8211; or yourself &#8211; to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
					<h5>About Carolyn</h5>

					<h5>Building a Mobile Layout</h5>
					<p>Designing for mobile is challenging. With the ever-changing landscape of devices and screen sizes, there is no way to predict every possible canvas we will be designing for. Luckily, there are a few tools at our disposal that allow us to be confident in our designs.</p>
					<p>In this session we will introduce some of these tools and dive into some code to see how they can be used to create designs that look great on any device.</p>
					<h5>About Darby</h5>
					<p>Darby Frey is a software engineer and consultant who has worked on web and mobile applications for many clients including Groupon, Toyota, Paramount Pictures and others. Currently he is working with Belly in Chicago to create the world&#8217;s best customer loyalty platform. He can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/darbyfrey">@darbyfrey</a>.</p>

					<h2>Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman</h2>
					<h5>Designing to Learn</h5>
					<p>We&#8217;ve reached a point where non-designers understand the value of design. This has led to an increase in demand for design talent. In the past, we would have turned to institutions of higher education to help us find new talent; however, today&#8217;s graduates often finish school without the skills they need to thrive in a professional design setting.</p>
					<p>There is a massive gap between what students learn and what industry needs. This skills gap leaves graduates unable to find jobs and hiring companies unable to find talent. How we approach this challenge will affect the continued relevance and value of design.</p>
					<h5>About Leslie</h5>
					<p><a href="http://www.jenseninman.com">Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman</a> is a designer, speaker, author, and educator. Leslie is co-founder of the user experience design school <a href="http://www.centercentre.com">Center Centre</a>, where she connects industry, education, and community.
